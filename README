HOW TO RUN THE INITIAL POC

1. Add monogodb connection url in .env
2. Run npm install
3. Run npm start <email>
   e.g., npm start admin@domain.com

--> You will see all the data of the organisation in your mongo db collection.
--> Message will be sent to the queue mentioned in the connection string.

Note: The above commands will automatically fetch the data from Google and save it to the local mongoodb instance.

Check the /src/index.js for more control over the data fetching.
